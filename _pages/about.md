# Hello!
* I am a Research Scientist at the Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things, Northeastern University, Boston. My supervisor is <a href="" target="_blank">Prof. Tommaso Melodia</a>. My research involves 5G networks, and a particular attention is given to end to end performance, mobility, reliability and consistency of performance of mmWave cellular. <a href="/assets/pdf/2020-05-neu-teaching.pdf">This is my CV</a>.

* Previously, I was a Postdoc and Adjunct Professor at the Department of Information Engineering of the University of Padova, where I also obtained my Ph.D. in 2020. My supervisor was <a href="https://scholar.google.it/citations?hl=en&user=Z7d93ZYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works" target="_blank">Prof. Michele Zorzi</a>. 

* This is our vision on future 6G networks, to be published in the IEEE Communications Magazine: "Towards 6G Networks: Use Cases and Technologies", available on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12216" target="_blank">arXiv</a>. 

* Take a look at <a href="/assets/pdf/itu-open.pdf" target="_blank">this presentation </a>on "Toward Open, Programmable, and Virtualized 5G Networks" for the ITU AI/ML in 5G Challenge.

* Our COMST paper (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8344116" target="_blank">Mezzavilla, Zhang, Polese et al, "End-to-end Simulations of 5G mmWave Networks"</a>) won the Best Journal Paper Award of the IEEE ComSoc Technical Committee on Communications Systems Integration and Modeling (CSIM) 2019.

* Our WNS3 paper (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3321351" target="_blank">De Biasio, Chiariotti, Polese, Zanella, Zorzi, "A QUIC Implementation for ns-3"</a>) won the Best Paper Award at WNS3 2019.

* I also visited New York University (NYU), in April 2017, and AT&T Labs in Bedminster, NJ, in May and June 2018.

* Check the <a href="/publications">publications section</a> to know more about these topics and the <a href="http://mmwave.dei.unipd.it" target="_blank">mmWave website @ DEI, UNIPD</a>.

* I recently presented some research results on a webinar for the IEEE Future Networks Initiative, you can find it <a href="https://ieee.webex.com/ec3300/eventcenter/recording/recordAction.do?siteurl=ieee&theAction=poprecord&recordID=56167302&internalRecordTicket=4832534b0000000420358179fdab7b09614f207a8e82ac16189a534f9ad0e81177718c062b2ac4e0" target="_blank">here</a>.

* I am interested in social and political issues, in particular the ones related to technology and the disruption brought by it. 

* I play the acoustic and the electric guitar, the banjo and the ukulele. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0ej1ZjzlDs" target="_blank">this video</a> from my band.

* I read a lot of books.
